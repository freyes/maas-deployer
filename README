This tool is used to deploy a virtual MAAS server, a virtual juju bootstrap node,
register physical hardware nodes, and kick off the Juju deployment of an openstack
cloud within the MAAS environment.

The deployment.yaml file contains a description of the environments, with various parts
describing the different pieces of the environment.

Upon completion of creating the virtual machines, etc, MAAS should be running at the
configured IP address (http://{address}/MAAS) with the login of dtadmin/ubuntu.

To deploy:

./setup.sh    # installs pre-requisites
./maas_deployer.py -c deployment.yaml    # creates the juju bootstrap and maas virtual machines


To cleanup and try again:
./clean.sh     # Note, this assumes default node names in sample deployment file.


What should work:
 - The MAAS node should be provisioned and configured.
 - The boot-images should be in progress of being downloaded.
 - configuration parameters configured in MAAS
 - nodes commissioning in maas
 - nodes tagged appropriately (api, bootstrap, etc)
 - environments.yaml file generated for juju environment
 - Nodes are commissioned and ready

Known Issues:
 - Juju scripts are not started automatically yet.
