This tool is used to deploy a virtual MAAS server, a virtual Juju bootstrap
node, register physical hardware nodes, and kick off the Juju deployment of an
Openstack cloud within the MAAS environment.

The deployment.yaml file contains a description of the environments, with
various parts describing the different pieces of the environment.

Upon completion of creating the virtual machines, etc, MAAS should be running
at the configured IP address (http://{address}/MAAS).


Install:

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maas-deployers/stable
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install maas-deployer


Deploy:

  # NOTE: assumes you have created yaml describing your cluster
  maas-deployer -c deployment.yaml


Cleanup and try again:

  maas-deployer -c deployment.yaml --force


What should work:
 - The MAAS node should be provisioned and configured
 - The boot-images should be in progress of being downloaded
 - configuration parameters configured in MAAS
 - nodes commissioning in maas
 - nodes tagged appropriately (api, bootstrap, etc)
 - environments.yaml file generated for juju environment
 - Nodes are commissioned and ready
